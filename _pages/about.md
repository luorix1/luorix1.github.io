Maker. Entrepreneur. Gymrat.
I love building things, as my journey below will show. With over three years in the startup world, I've honed a passion for user-centric design, bioengineering, and transforming UX through technology.

As a proud generalist, I specialize in MAKING THINGS WORK while collaborating with specialists to elevate ideas to the next level.

Currently, I’m the CEO & co-founder of Ethereal, where we're revolutionizing 3D modeling. Our ultimate vision is bridging the gap between XR and reality, enabling lifelike interactions with deformable objects. Our innovation earned CES 2025 Innovation Awards Honoree recognition.

I also hold multiple patents, from solar-powered sprinklers to multi-view pedestrian detection systems for offline analytics.

I’m always up for a conversation—whether you're a seasoned founder, a curious newcomer, or somewhere in between. Let’s connect!

========================================================================

My vision is to improve user experiences, regardless of domain. People often come across bad UX, myself being no exception. I suspect that is why many startups often focus on good UX as what sets them apart from their competitors.

My current interests are mainly in rehabilitation robotics, powered prostheses, and exosuits. I am taking part in research projects that blend machine learning, biomechanics, and signal processing techniques. I'm most interested in the advancement and commercialization of exosuits and powered prostheses for patients that incorporate an interface for user intentions harnessing neural/muscular electrical signals.

However, another key interest I have is the domain of 3-4D media, particularly 3D modeling and the "streaming" of 4D media (3D video). CAD modeling is not very intuitive, and many problems such as the new push by Dassault to migrate SolidWorks to their own engine (and failing, in my opinion) have mad it even worse. I believe that people who are good at making physical prototypes (i.e. sculptors, metal workers, etc.) are also capable of creating digital 3D assets and want to empower them. The end goal for this is to enable realistic interaction w/ haptic feedback for deformable objects in XR. Essentially, you could "sculpt" your own mockup in 3D and it could immediately be used as a 3D asset.
