<p>Ethereal suggests a new paradigm of intuitive 3D modelling through a physical digital-twin interface. 3D data can be created as a real-time synced digital twin, directly formed and modified via user input on the physical build plate. The 45x45 array of modular pins that compose the build plate are controlled via a microcontroller and a series of linear actuators to mimic parts of the 3D model's surface. Panning, rotating and zooming the digital twin model through the embedded touch screen in reorientation mode, users can also update the model surface displayed on the screen onto the build plate.</p>
