[FIFO: Learning Fog-invariant Features for Foggy Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01587)

previous work

- combat lack of “foggy” training data with synthetic “fog”
- curriculum adaptation
    - increase density of “fog” as training progresses
    - finally adapt to real light fog + dense synthetic fog data

- previous work showed performance degradation on clear images! (-11.3%)
- were also very dependent on hyperparameter tuning and external fog density estimator

proposed method

- learn features invariant to fog conditions
    - no hyper-parameters that control fog density in training
    - no extra modules needed to estimate fog density in real setting

- clear weather, synthetic fog, real fog all given as input to segmentation network
- create embedding “fog factor”
    - constrain so that “fog factor”s are unaffected by fog conditions
- fog affects image style → use Gram matrix
    - account for other background and object effects with a “fog-pass filtering module”
- update alternately between segmentation network & fog-pass filter
    - at test time, only run forward pass on segmentation network
- loss
    - fog-pass filter
        - attracting L2 distance in embedding space for similar fog conditions, repelling L2 distance for different fog conditions
    - segmentation
        - segmentation loss + fog style matching loss + prediction loss
- effect of fog-pass filter
    - using only Gram matrix fails to differentiate between clear and synthetic fog conditions
- image reconstructing using FIFO also works!

ablations and analysis

- outperforms previous methods in both foggy and clear conditions
- all components shown to have meaningful impact on results
- results on unseen weather conditions like rain prove “fog factor”s can help with those conditions as well (to an extent)
