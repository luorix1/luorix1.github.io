[Re-Aging GAN: Toward Personalized Face Age Transformation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Makhmudkhujaev_Re-Aging_GAN_Toward_Personalized_Face_Age_Transformation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)

motivation

- face age transformation should
    - maintain the identity of the input image
    - have wide-range target age characteristics
    - generate natural-looking faces

proposed method

- output from encoder is given as input along with the target age to a simple CNN
- the output from this “modulator” is given to the decoder along with the encoder output to generate a new image that has a more consistent identity compared to prior works
- each layer of the decoder if fed output from the age modulator! (age-aware features)
- use a cycle-consistency loss where we age from $t$ to $t'$ and from $t'$ to $t$ again
    - the end result should be similar to the original image
- also use a reconstruction loss where aging from $t$ to $t$ should make almost no difference

extension (video re-aging)

- requires some form of temporal consistency
    - previous, frame-based approaches lack consistency
- encoder and modulator networks involve some form of smoothing
    - modulator also includes some new multi-scale aspects
    - this provides some (unexplained) temporal consistency
