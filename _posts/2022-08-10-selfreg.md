[SelfReg: Self-supervised Contrastive Regularization for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09841)

domain adaptation VS domain generalization

proposed method

- use positive pairs (of the same class) in domain generalization
- a contrastive learning-style approach
- a loss based on the intermediate features + a loss based on the logits
    - regardless of domain, order the input in the batch based on class
    - after running through feature extractor & classifier, calculate losses
    - $L_{feature}$ and $L_{logit}$ calculated through a regularization block
        - CDPL into shuffling
        - loss with shuffled version & with a version that applies mixup to the shuffled ones
- gradient stabilization
    - loss clipping
        - self-regularization loss was too dominant after initial training phase
    - inter-domain curriculum learning
        - incrementally add in classes
        - use SWA afterward (at the epoch level)
